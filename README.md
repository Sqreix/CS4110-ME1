Christian Lexis H. Tan's Reaction Paper on Alan Turing’s “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” (1950).

Based on the paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" published in 1950 by Alan Turing, this work is one of the pioneers of the question, "Can machines think?" It shifts from the definition of "thinking" to whether a machine can imitate human behavior quite well with the introduction of the Turing Test. The practical perspective continues to shape modern artificial intelligence, giving more importance to measurable performance rather than abstract definitions of intelligence.

One of the most striking aspects of Turing's work is how it contests human biases surrounding the issue of intelligence. He denies that machines cannot have qualities such as creativity or emotion since these could be modeled too. His insights foreshadowed the developments in AI specifically in machine learning where, for example, computers already outsmart humans in some areas of data analysis and recognizing patterns.

Philosophical Objections to his Mind: Turing also addresses all kinds of philosophical objections, which include the "Argument from Consciousness," whereby machines can only think if they are conscious. Turing says that the person who argued this was not sensible in his expectation since we can't even prove that men are conscious. This remains a critical issue in contemporary AI ethics, particularly as machines grow more sophisticated.

The original consideration of machine intelligence, in light of the possibilities and challenges that lie within, points out the rationale and ethics of what can be expected to happen in the future. Being interested in behavior and performance led to the tasks of AI development, but his appreciation for limits on both human and artificial intelligence leaves questions open for further research. As AI picks up momentum, Turing's work becomes the influential text that pushes one into the question of what intelligence means.
